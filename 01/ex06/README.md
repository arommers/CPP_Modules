## Harl Filter
So were back it with Harl and his barrage of nonsense messages. This time around though we are requested to give Harl a certain message level and have him shout out each one in ascending order starting from the level provided.
A quick reminder for the level messages:
- DEBUG
- INFO
- WARNING
- ERROR

So if we provided our program with the string 'INFO', Harl should print out the INFO, WARNING and ERROR messages. If we gave him "WARNING" he would spew out the WARNING and ERROR messages. etc. etc.
We could construct a set of "if/else" statements, but that would become quite convoluted and ugly. There is a more elegant apporach that the subject file heavily hints at :
