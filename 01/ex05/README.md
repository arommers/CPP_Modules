## Harl 2.0
So I'll have to be honest and admit that I have no idea what the titular 'Harl' int this assignment is or should represent. My best guess is that it is some off brand reference to the semi-sentient software 'Hal' from the movie 2001: A space oddity. A piece of software that spouts different levels of warning errors based on the state of things, I guess....  

The levels of messages it produces are:
- **DEBUG** level: Debug messages contain contextual information. They are mostly
  used for problem diagnosis.
- **INFO** level: These messages contain extensive information. They are helpful for
  tracing program execution in a production environment.
- **WARNING** level: Warning messages indicate a potential issue in the system.
  However, it can be handled or ignored.
- **ERROR** level: These messages indicate an unrecoverable error has occurred.
  This is usually a critical issue that requires manual intervention.

To make the assignment even more confusing 'Harl' seems to be slurring about bacon. Luckily, the contents of the error messages are actually irrelevant. They each display a different message when invoked. What is important to us is, how they are invoked.
