## Now Weâ€™re Talking
Continuing to enhance our 'Fixed' class by adding more operator overloads and some static member functions. Just more customization so that our compiler doesn't get confused. 

- #### Comparison Operators
  Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=):
  Compare instances of Fixed to determine their relationship (greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, equal to, not equal to).
- #### Arithmetic Operators
  Assignment (=) Operator:
  Assigns the value of another Fixed instance to the current instance.
- #### Binary Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /):
  Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two Fixed instances, returning a new instance as the result.
- #### Increment/Decrement Operators
  Increment/Decrement Operators (++, --):
  Increase or decrease the value of a Fixed instance, either in a pre-increment/decrement (returning the updated instance) or post-increment/decrement (returning a copy before the change).
- #### Static Member Functions
  Static Member Functions (min, max):
  Compare two Fixed instances and return a reference to the smaller (min) or larger (max) instance. Static functions as they do not operate on a specific instance but on the class as a whole.
