## Now Weâ€™re Talking

### Comparison Operators
  Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=):
  Compare instances of Fixed to determine their relationship (greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, equal to, not equal to).


### Arithmetic Operators
  Assignment (=) Operator:
  Assigns the value of another Fixed instance to the current instance.
#### Binary Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /):
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two Fixed instances, returning a new instance as the result.

### Increment/Decrement Operators
Increment/Decrement Operators (++, --):
Increase or decrease the value of a Fixed instance, either in a pre-increment/decrement (returning the updated instance) or post-increment/decrement (returning a copy before the change).

### Static Member Functions
Static Member Functions (min, max):
Compare two Fixed instances and return a reference to the smaller (min) or larger (max) instance. Static functions as they do not operate on a specific instance but on the class as a whole.
