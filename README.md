# ** README AND MODULES ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS **

## CPP_Modules
A collection of projects that form a comprehensive set of programming exercises designed to develop proficiency in C++. 
These modules cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced data structures and algorithms.

Each module contains several exercises that are selfcontained and respectively deal with solving a particular problem.


## Key Concepts
- **Hands-On Learning:** Each module is structured around practical exercises that focus on one or more C++ concepts.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** The modules are organized in a progressive manner, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually building up to more complex topics.
- **Diverse Topics:** Topics include data types, loops, arrays, pointers, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, standard library functions, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Focus on the principles of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **STL Containers:** Explores the Standard Template Library (STL) and its various container classes like vectors, lists, and maps
