## Megaphone
The purpose of this assignment is to write a program that would take any number of strings as input and handles them in a manner as shown in the example below:

![ERROR](https://i.imgur.com/XmbVgb2.png)


Meaning that the program is basically a glorified "[toupper](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/toupper/?kw=toupper)" function.

### Key concepts
This project is my  introduction and limits the amount of C++'ness to a minimum.
It focuses on namespaces, the use of the scope resolution operator and the standard output stream.

#### Namespaces
In C++, a namespace is a way to group together related names (such as classes, functions, and variables) and avoid naming conflicts.
The std namespace specifically contains many standard C++ libraries and functions provided by the Standard Template Library (STL).
#### Scope resolution operator
This operator denoted as `::` specifies the scope of a variable, function, or class member
and is used to shows entities (variables, functions, or classes) in a namespace, class, or structure.
#### The standard output stream
`std::cout << "Hello, World! << std::endl;`
- `cout` is an instance of the [ostream class](https://cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/ostream/?kw=ostream), which is used for output operations. It represents the standard output stream, typically the console.
- You can use `cout` to display information on the console and the above examples shows us the syntax.
- The `<<` operator is called the insertion operator. It is used to insert data into the output.
- Multiple items can be chained together using the `<<` operator as we saw in our hello world example.
- `std::endl` is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer.
