# The Job of Your Dreams
Well, we finally made it. Our first job as a software engineer. The orginization however is an absolute mess that is only outdone by their data management.
Files are missing left and right. Particularly, a function definition file of some accounts. Befitting of our position, we have to fix this. Probably because no one else wants to.

Our objective is to resurrect a missing file using available resources: The surviving header file, Account.hpp, and a detailed log file.
The header file contains the declarations for all our functions and the log file what these files will output.
