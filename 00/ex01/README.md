## My Awesome Phonebook
The goal of this project is to create a program that emulates an 80's-style phonebook.  
This will involve two main classes: Contact and Phonebook.  

Contact Class:  
- The Contact class will hold essential information such as first name, last name, and phone number.

Phonebook Class:  
- The Phonebook class will manage a collection of contacts. It will have a maximum capacity of 8 contacts.

On program start-up, the phonebook is empty and the user is prompted to enter one
of three commands.  
The program only accepts ADD, SEARCH and EXIT.
